## What is this website about?

Rock Paper Scissors is a zero-sum game usually played by two people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and will lead to an outcome.

### What are the rules of RPS?
Although the game has a lot of complexity, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. 3 simple rules determine the outcome of the game:

- Rock wins against scissors.
- Scissors win against the paper.
- Paper wins against the rock.
